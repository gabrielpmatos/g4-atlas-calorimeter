# Geant4-models
This repository contains few Geant4 models:

* [ATLAS-simplified](ATLAS-simplified): A simplified version of ATLAS detector calorimeter.


## ATLAS-simplified

A simplified version of the ATLAS detector calorimeter. This setup incorporates the concept of a sampling calorimeter.
The detector granularity matches the ATLAS geometry at &eta;=0 (barrel). The detector composited from 6 layers:
3 form the Electro-Magnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) and 3 forms the Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL).
