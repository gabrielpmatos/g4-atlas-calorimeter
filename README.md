* ATLAS-simplified: A simplified version of ATLAS detector callorimeter


## ATLAS-simplified

A simplified version of ATLAS detector callorimeter incorporating the concept of a sampling callorimeter
The detector granularity matches ATLAS geometry at $\eta$=0 (barrel). The detector conposited from 6 layers:
3 form the Electro-Magnetic Callorimeter (ECAL) and 3 form the Hadronid Callorimeter (HCAL).
