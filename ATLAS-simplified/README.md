# ATLAS toy geometry

A (very) simplified version of [ATLAS detector](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/3/08/S08003) callorimeter incorporating the concept of a sampling callorimeter.
Full technical details on the calorimeter design can be found in ([ECAL ref](https://cds.cern.ch/record/331061/files/CERN-LHCC-96-41.pdf)) 
and in [HCAL ref](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2004868/files/ATL-TILECAL-PROC-2015-002.pdf).
The detector granularity matches ATLAS geometry at &eta;=0 (barrel). The detector conposited from 6 layers:
3 form the Electro-Magnetic Callorimeter (ECAL) and 3 form the Hadronid Callorimeter (HCAL).
A side view of the detector setup is shown in Fig. 1.

### ECAL geometry:

Electro-Magnetic calorimeter composed from 3 layers. It consist of pasive layers,
1.5 mm each of lead (Pb) and a 4.5 mm gap of liquid argon (LAr) used as a sensitive layer. The passibe lead layers 
are placed in accordion geometry shape and the gaps were filled with LAr as shown in Fig 2.

The energy resolution of ECAL geometry was simulated to be &sigma;/E=6.5%/&sqrt;E, which is controled by electro-magnetic energy
 sampling fraction of about 25%.
 
Cell granularity was defined similar to ATLAS ECAL granularity at &eta;=0:
