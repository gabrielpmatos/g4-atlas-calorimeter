# ATLAS toy geometry

This example contain ATLAS experiment [link] toy geometry

A simplified version of ATLAS detector [link] callorimeter incorporating the concept of a sampling callorimeter.
Full technical details on the calorimeter design can be found [ECAL ref] and [HCAL ref].
The detector granularity matches ATLAS geometry at $\eta$=0 (barrel). The detector conposited from 6 layers:
3 form the Electro-Magnetic Callorimeter (ECAL) and 3 form the Hadronid Callorimeter (HCAL).
A side view of the detector setup is shown in Fig. 1.

### ECAL geometry:

Electro-Magnetic calorimeter composed from 3 layers, in accordion geometry shape .... (to be filled)
